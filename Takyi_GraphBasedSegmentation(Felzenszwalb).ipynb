    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Image segmentation is a fundamental task in image processing that involves dividing an image into meaningful and coherent regions. This simplifies image analysis and is widely applied in object recognition, medical imaging, and scene understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Graph-based segmentation techniques model an image as a graph where pixels are represented as nodes and edges encode similarity between neighboring pixels. One efficient and widely used graph-based approach is the Felzenszwalb-Huttenlocher algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project implements and analyses the Felzenszwalb graph-based segmentation algorithm using Python and evaluates its performance on natural images.\n",

    "### 2.2 Felzenszwalb-Huttenlocher Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm starts by treating each pixel as an individual segment. All graph edges are sorted in increasing order of weight. Segments are merged iteratively if the difference between them is small relative to their internal variation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The merging condition is defined as:\n",
