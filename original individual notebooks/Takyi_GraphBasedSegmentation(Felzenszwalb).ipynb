# Graph-Based Image Segmentation Using the Felzenszwalb Algorithm



---

## 1. Introduction

Image segmentation is a fundamental task in image processing that involves dividing an image into meaningful and coherent regions. This process simplifies image analysis by grouping pixels with similar characteristics and is widely used in applications such as object recognition, medical imaging, and scene understanding.

Graph-based segmentation techniques model an image as a graph where pixels are represented as nodes and edges encode similarity between neighboring pixels. One efficient and widely used graph-based approach is the Felzenszwalb-Huttenlocher algorithm.

This project implements and analyses the Felzenszwalb graph-based segmentation algorithm using Python and evaluates its performance on natural images.

## 2. Theoretical Foundation

### 2.1 Graph Representation of Images

An image can be modeled as an undirected weighted graph:

- **Vertices (V):** Pixels in the image  
- **Edges (E):** Connections between neighboring pixels  
- **Edge weights:** Measure of dissimilarity between pixels  

\[
G = (V, E)
\]

Edge weights are commonly computed using the Euclidean distance between pixel intensity values or color vectors.

---

### 2.2 Felzenszwalb-Huttenlocher Algorithm

The algorithm starts by treating each pixel as an individual segment. All edges in the graph are sorted in increasing order of weight. Regions are merged iteratively based on a comparison between the difference of two regions and their internal variability.

The merging condition is defined as:

\[
D(C_1, C_2) \le \min(\text{Int}(C_1) + \tau(C_1), \text{Int}(C_2) + \tau(C_2))
\]

Where:
- \( D(C_1, C_2) \) is the difference between two components  
- \( \text{Int}(C) \) is the internal difference within a component  
- \( \tau(C) = \frac{k}{|C|} \)  
- \( k \) is a scale parameter controlling segmentation granularity  

---

### 2.3 Algorithm Parameters

- **scale (k):** Controls the size of segments  
- **sigma:** Standard deviation for Gaussian smoothing  
- **min_size:** Minimum allowed segment size

## 4. Implementation
```

```python
# Import required libraries
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

from skimage import io
from skimage.segmentation import felzenszwalb
from skimage.color import label2rgb
```

```python
# Load a natural image (ensure this file exists in your GitHub repo)
image = io.imread('sample.jpg')

plt.figure(figsize=(6, 6))
plt.imshow(image)
plt.title("Original Image")
plt.axis('off')
plt.show()
```

```python
# Apply Felzenszwalb segmentation
segments = felzenszwalb(
    image,
    scale=100,
    sigma=0.5,
    min_size=50
)

print("Number of segments:", len(np.unique(segments)))
```

```python
# Visualize segmented output
segmented_image = label2rgb(segments, image, kind='avg')

plt.figure(figsize=(6, 6))
plt.imshow(segmented_image)
plt.title("Felzenszwalb Segmentation Result")
plt.axis('off')
plt.show()
```

```python
# Comparative analysis with different scale values
scales = [50, 100, 200]

plt.figure(figsize=(15, 5))

for i, scale in enumerate(scales):
    seg = felzenszwalb(image, scale=scale, sigma=0.5, min_size=50)
    seg_img = label2rgb(seg, image, kind='avg')
    
    plt.subplot(1, 3, i + 1)
    plt.imshow(seg_img)
    plt.title(f"Scale = {scale}")
    plt.axis('off')

plt.show()
```

## 5. Results

The results show that the Felzenszwalb algorithm effectively partitions natural images into visually meaningful regions. Smaller scale values produce finer segmentation, while larger scale values result in fewer and larger regions.

The method preserves important boundaries and performs well on natural images with varying textures and colors.

## 6. Discussion

### Strengths
- Computationally efficient  
- Produces coherent and meaningful segments  
- Suitable for large natural images  

### Limitations
- Sensitive to parameter tuning  
- Over-segmentation may occur in highly textured regions  
- Does not provide semantic interpretation  

### Real-World Applications
- Object detection preprocessing  
- Medical image analysis  
- Image compression  
- Scene understanding

## 7. Conclusion

This project implemented graph-based image segmentation using the Felzenszwalb algorithm. The method efficiently segments natural images while preserving essential boundary information.

Despite its sensitivity to parameter selection, the algorithm remains a powerful and scalable segmentation approach. Future work may integrate this method with machine learning techniques for higher-level semantic understanding.
